# Mamba

A CLI that takes ambigious "resources" and creates a sequence of nodejs microservices.

Koa isn't really a framework, it's more of a library.

This is a framework, w/ the benefits of:
- code reuse
- common config
- common utils
- worker delegation
- service delegation


Commands
- status
- watch
- build
- deploy
