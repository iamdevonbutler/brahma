where we left off:

config (app config)
- we validate config in `status` - called before build.
- dont load config in vorpal boot.
- do load config and validate in status - perhaps these are 2 files.-
- dont validate config in /build/server in statup.js - we just did that. just load.


config (env)
- somewhere, maybe in startup.js, we need to validate the env. make sure appName is set.
- keep in mind we are lazilly loading config. this is a feature of the forever server.
