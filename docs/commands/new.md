@todo

clones git repos (does not require git be installed locally)

- git clone repos (brahma-boilerplate)
- should have a command or flag to build site w/ config folders vs config files and
folders vs files for other shit.

- asks you plugin config like npm init. if u type some shit it, like brahma-plugin-NAME, we request npm and github and see if it exists before we allow it.

@todo functionality
- ask plugin info first, and other info, and write files last. sometimes u fuck up a config question and want to ctrl-c ur app, but if u already have files there, u gotta either remote and restart or find the config u fucked up. hedge against a bad habit.
