# Config

## Organization
All config files can be organized:
- as a `single file` at: `./config/TYPE.js`.
- as a `collection of files` w/i a folder `./config/TYPE/index.js`.

Larger projects may warrant "folder" organization, while smaller projects will benefit from the simplicity of "file" organization.

### File organization:

@todo provide example configs for each.
