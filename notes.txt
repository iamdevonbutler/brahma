"system" tests?
- So I just made this term up. Maybe it's a thing, but idk.
Yeah, these are called `integration` tests by most.
To me, the word integration is far too often overused as an ambigious high-level
classification by business people attempting to create the facade that their
produce or service is superior in some sort of way that is usually unclear.
And i'm just sick of business people trying to blow smoke.
So let's be to the point..."system" tests test a live system - the collection
of connected applications produced in `./build`. If you still call them integration
test's I wont get mad.

"hooks" vs "callbacks" vs "..."
"Hooks" imply intentionality.
When you hook into a system, you do so w/ the intent to modify/extend behavior.
Brahma hooks extend the `start()`, `stop()`, and `update()` behavior.
The word "callback" is more general - it's just code that gets called after something happens. The reason for
calling the code back is not implied - it can be anything.

"args" vs "params"
- i like both. probably params a bit more.
- But JS uses "arguments" and "...args" and you rarely see "params"; so ill stay true to tradition here.
